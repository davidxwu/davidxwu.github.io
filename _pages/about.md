I am a second year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, where I'm extremely fortunate to be coadvised by [Prasad Raghavendra](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/) and [Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html). I'm broadly interested in problems at the intersection of theoretical computer science and statistics, including topics such as computational complexity of statistical inference, Markov chains for sampling, machine learning theory, and optimization. I graduated with a B.Sc. from MIT with a double major in mathematics (Course 18) and computer science (Course 6-3). I'm grateful to be supported by an NSF GRFP fellowship.
