I am a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, where I'm extremely fortunate to be coadvised by [Prasad Raghavendra](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/) and [Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html). 
I'm broadly interested in problems at the intersection of theoretical computer science and statistics, such as Markov chains, statistical inference, and machine learning theory. 
Last summer, I was an ML research intern at Windsurf working on coding agent capabilities and evals. 
I'm grateful to be supported by an NSF GRFP fellowship and an OpenAI Superalignment Grant.

I graduated with a B.Sc. from MIT with a double major in mathematics (Course 18) and computer science (Course 6-3), where I was lucky to do research with [Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/) and [Suvrit Sra](https://optml.mit.edu/). As an undergrad, I interned in quant finance at HRT and Akuna Capital.
